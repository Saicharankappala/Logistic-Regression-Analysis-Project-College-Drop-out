# Logistic-Regression-Analysis-Project-College-Drop-out
Mt. Michel College faced a persistent challenge with student attrition over the past few years, particularly with many students leaving after their first year. To address this issue, the college implemented a seminar course aimed at improving student retention. I conducted an evaluation of the seminarâ€™s effectiveness in promoting student retention and analyzed the impact of high school GPA and unit enrollment on student drop-out rates. Additionally, I incorporated demographic data provided by the college to enhance the analysis and gain deeper insights into the factors influencing student attrition.
